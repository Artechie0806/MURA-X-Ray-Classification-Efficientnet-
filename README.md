# üß† MURA X-Ray Classification using EfficientNet

This project focuses on detecting abnormalities in musculoskeletal X-ray images using deep learning, specifically through the **EfficientNetB0** architecture. It utilizes the **MURA (Musculoskeletal Radiographs)** dataset ‚Äî one of the largest publicly available medical imaging datasets, released by the **Stanford ML Group**.

The MURA dataset contains **over 40,000 images from nearly 15,000 studies**, across **seven upper extremity body parts**:

- Elbow  
- Finger  
- Forearm  
- Hand  
- Humerus  
- Shoulder  
- Wrist  

Each study is labeled as either **normal** or **abnormal** based on expert radiologist interpretation. This rich dataset offers a valuable foundation for developing machine learning models to support clinical diagnostics.

In this project, I built a classification pipeline using **EfficientNetB0**, enhanced through **transfer learning**. The goal is to enable reliable identification of abnormal X-rays, potentially assisting radiologists in real-world diagnostic tasks.

## üìä Model Performance

| Metric      | Model 1 (Baseline) | Model 2 (EfficientNetB0) |
|-------------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Accuracy    | 59%                | **85%**                   |
| Precision   | 64% (macro avg)    | **85%** (macro avg)       |
| Recall      | 63% (macro avg)    | **84%** (macro avg)       |
| F1-Score    | 59% (macro avg)    | **84%** (macro avg)       |

üß† The second model‚Äîpowered by EfficientNetB0‚Äîdelivered a significant performance jump, reaching **85% accuracy** and showing balanced results across both classes.
